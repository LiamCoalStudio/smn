# Simon
![CMake](https://github.com/LiamCoal/smn/workflows/CMake/badge.svg)
*a programming language named after cat*

## What is a Simon?
Simon is a simple programming language written in C++. It generates code for other programming languages using a different syntax.

## Building your own Simon
1. `cmake .`
2. `cmake --build .`
3. `cmake --install .`

## How do I use it!?
You can use `smn` to run Simon. All it needs is the path to a `.smn` file and a `-o <output_file>` option. There is a simon file in this repo called `test.smn`. This is where I test simon, so you should compile and run it after an install to make sure Simon is installed correctly.
